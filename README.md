![Microservice architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43842212/176205739-d5851cdb-3b62-4dcd-9894-67dfd44a326d.png)

There is a couple of microservices which implemented e-commerce modules over Catalog, Basket, Discount and Ordering microservices with NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) and Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server) with communicating over RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication and using Ocelot API Gateway.

And here continuation of the main course -> Microservices Observability with Distributed Logging, Health Monitoring, Resilient and Fault Tolerance with using Polly

Run multiple different API Gateway/BFF container types
The Gateway aggregation pattern in Shopping.Aggregator
WebUI ShoppingApp Microservice
ASP.NET Core Web Application with Bootstrap 4 and Razor template
Call Ocelot APIs with HttpClientFactory and Polly
Microservices Cross-Cutting Implementations
Implementing Centralized Distributed Logging with Elastic Stack (ELK); Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and SeriLog for Microservices
Use the HealthChecks feature in back-end ASP.NET microservices
Using Watchdog in separate service that can watch health and load across services, and report health about the microservices by querying with the HealthChecks
Microservices Resilience Implementations
Making Microservices more resilient Use IHttpClientFactory to implement resilient HTTP requests
Implement Retry and Circuit Breaker patterns with exponential backoff with IHttpClientFactory and Polly policies
Ancillary Containers
Use Portainer for Container lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your different Docker environments
pgAdmin PostgreSQL Tools feature rich Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL
Docker Compose establishment with all microservices on docker;
Containerization of microservices
Containerization of databases
Override Environment variables
Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

Visual Studio 2019
.Net Core 5 or later
Docker Desktop
Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)

Clone the repository
Once Docker for Windows is installed, go to the Settings > Advanced option, from the Docker icon in the system tray, to configure the minimum amount of memory and CPU like so:
Memory: 4 GB
CPU: 2
At the root directory which include docker-compose.yml files, run below command:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up -d
Note: If you get connection timeout error Docker for Mac please Turn Off Docker's "Experimental Features".

Wait for docker compose all microservices. That’s it! (some microservices need extra time to work so please wait if not worked in first shut)

You can launch microservices as below urls:

Catalog API -> http://localhost:8001/swagger/index.html

Basket API -> http://localhost:8002/swagger/index.html

Discount API -> http://localhost:8003/swagger/index.html

Ordering API -> http://localhost:8005/swagger/index.html

Shopping.Aggregator -> http://localhost:8010/swagger/index.html

API Gateway -> http://localhost:8000/Catalog

Rabbit Management Dashboard -> http://localhost:15672 -- guest/guest

Portainer -> http://localhost:9000 -- admin/36RR45ey@@@@

pgAdmin PostgreSQL -> http://localhost:5050 -- admin@aspnetrun.com/admin1234

Elasticsearch -> http://localhost:9200

Kibana -> http://localhost:5601

Web Status -> http://localhost:8012

Web UI -> http://localhost:8011

Launch http://host.docker.internal:8007 in your browser to view the Web Status. Make sure that every microservices are healthy.
Launch http://host.docker.internal:8006 in your browser to view the Web UI. You can use Web project in order to call microservices over API Gateway. When you checkout the basket you can follow queue record on RabbitMQ dashboard.
